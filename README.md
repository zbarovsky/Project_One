# 2021 - A Zombie Survival Game

## Game idea

2D Dungeon crawler where you're in a house full of zombies trying to clear out the house to survive for the night.
Each room will spawn a random amount of zombies to fight off. Health will be low and once dead, the game will give a game over and you have to restart.

No one quite knows how it started, WW3, Corona, tear gas, the "deep fake". But whatever it was, it ended with zombies. Those who survived are now stuck scavenging for food and shelter. Enter you, it's late and your group has tasked you with clearing out and finding shelter before it gets too late.

- zombie boss in specific room
- health regen abilities (i.e. find a heart = gain more life)
- cool sound effects
- Add your own name
- time attack mode - race against the clock.

## Roadblocks
